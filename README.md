# Fake-News-Detection
This is my first Artificial Intelligence Project for an AI Hackathon. The challenge was to build an AI solution based on The Transformers Architecture (GPT-3 Powered by AI). 

#How to power it ? 

# Python 

1. Extract the Fake and True datasets zip files 
2. Open the Jupyter notebook 
3. Install the necessary librairies 
4. Execute :) 

Within the python implementation, 4 classifications models were implemented : Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree and Logistic Regression 
In order to tell which of the fellow models is the optimal one 

# Node.js 
A web interface of this project has been released by the use of Node.js, Replit and OpenAI's GPT-3
